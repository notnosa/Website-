            <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Nosa Edomwande. I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, and I’m currently an IT major, graduating in 2026. Throughout my childhood, I was active in various sports like basketball, soccer, and football, but in high school, I focused solely on basketball.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Recently, I started a YouTube channel, fulfilling a long-time goal of building a platform where I can share my thoughts and perspectives. I’m thrilled to have reached over 100,000 views within the first few months, and I’m excited about the channel’s future growth.</p>

        <p>As a first-generation American, with both of my parents originally from Nigeria, I am motivated to make them proud—by graduating college and working toward a future where they won’t have to work anymore.</p>

        <p>In college, I’ve been preparing for a career in DevOps and am actively pursuing internships in that field. I’ve also taught myself video editing, and I’m considering whether a career in media production might also be a path I’d like to explore.</p>
